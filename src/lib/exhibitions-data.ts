      "Presented at Gallery88 in Paarl, this exhibition brought together a body of work shaped by two studios and two landscapes. The paintings sit between memory and encounter, holding traces of the South African terrain within a European painterly language. Rooted in slow layering, pigment shifts and painterly restraint, the works invite quiet looking. The presentation was conceived as an unfolding sequence — a room to be crossed rather than consumed — allowing each painting to hold its own atmosphere before entering into dialogue with the next.",

      "Held within the stone-walled halls of the Spice Route Destination, this exhibition placed painting in direct conversation with landscape, architecture and the material history of the site. The works — dense, warm, elemental — echoed the ochre, ash and shadow of the surrounding terrain. The exhibition unfolded as a slow walk through space, with each painting inviting a moment of stillness inside an active hospitality context. Presented under the banner of Where We Stand, the presentation reflected on rootedness and passage between two homelands.",

The exhibition proposed painting as a slow language for memory, inheritance and relation, with each figure carrying a quiet weight of listening. The presentation kept an intentionally spacious rhythm, allowing the works to speak in a whisper rather than a statement. Its atmosphere was set by natural light, warm earth tones and a small ceramic vocabulary placed among the paintings.",

      "The Blessing was conceived as a studio exhibition — a moment where the painter's working space briefly opened as a public setting. The paintings, deep in tone and quietly luminous, remained close to the surfaces on which they were made. Rather than translating the works into a neutral white cube, the presentation kept them within concrete walls and warm light, preserving the texture of the studio itself. The result was a viewing situation that felt more like an encounter than an exhibition.",

Within the exhibition, the contributed works pursued a painterly threshold — bodies suggested through gesture, forms held in suspension between recognisable and abstract. The presentation invited a slow reading, allowing each work to enter the shared conversation on its own terms while contributing to a wider chorus around presence, feminine authorship and inherited image.",

      "Hara Flux gathered a suite of paintings held together by a single inquiry: how the body carries centre, breath and quiet duration. The works remained close to a warm, near-monochrome register, with subtle shifts in pigment marking presence rather than event. Presented in a spare Brussels gallery corner, the exhibition read as a considered pause — a small, precisely tuned proposition about painting as containment and release.",
